# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a front-end project where Iâ€™ve implemented four sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. It uses NodeJS and ExpressJS. The visualizer represents numbers as bars, with their heights corresponding to the values, and highlights them with colours during sorting.
